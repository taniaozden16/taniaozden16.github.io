			           <p> Through the volunteering in YAS Club I have got a insight of the importance of serving my community. Collecting money for the orphanage gave me a feeling that I am a part of something bigger. It is wonderful to realize that you can bring some changes even by doing small but so important things. Let's move and change our world together! </p>
