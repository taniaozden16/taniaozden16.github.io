						<p> All my life I took an active part in a school life. We initiated numerous clubs and groups. Among them was health propaganda team. The purpose of it was to promote healthy lifestyle. Every year we had a competition on promoting healthy habits and actions. Every shool in my town used to deligate a team. It was an honor to be a part of a team for three consecutive years, taking the first place every time! </p>
